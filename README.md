Share opening times with your friends, so you don't have to be up at 5AM UTC and can still compete.

## How to use it?

1. Install the browser extension
2. Open a private leaderboard
3. Click on [Ordering] and select the new [NoRush Score] option
4. Hover over the * z Δ o ✔ # icons and day nums in the table header for more details

## How does it work?

Your browser captures page visitation info in its history. The extension scans this for the AoC tasks' urls and uploads the earliest (first) times to its backend.

When you open a private leaderboard, the backend provides task opening times for all members with the extension installed.

NoRush score is calculated based on the time it took for you to solve the task from when you first opened its description.
